# Text-Visualization using scattertext
A very powerful and informative library for text visualization is "Scattertext". I have used formspring data (https://www.kaggle.com/swetaagrawal/formspring-data-for-cyberbullying-detection) as the input text data.
Tuorials and installation instructions for scattertext library can be accessed from the authors github page: 
"https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext"

# Steps
1. Clean and extract the data with binary calssificatin using the extract.py
2. Visualize using the viz_scattetext.ipyb notebook
