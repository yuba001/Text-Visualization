# Text-Visualization using scattertext

**Scattertext** is a very powerful and informative library for text visualization. The project is actively developed by Jason Kessler "https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext". I have used formspring data (https://www.kaggle.com/swetaagrawal/formspring-data-for-cyberbullying-detection) as the input text data, and used the **scattertext module** to visualize the data. 
## Installation: 
$ pip install scattertext && python -m spacy.en.download
(Python 3.4 or higher)


# Steps
1. Clean and extract the data with binary calssificatin using the extract.py
2. Follow the steps in the viz_scattetext.ipyb notebook
